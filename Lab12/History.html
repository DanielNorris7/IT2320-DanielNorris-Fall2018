            <h1>The History Of Cleveland</h1>
            <div>
                Cleveland was the first settlement founded in the Connecticut Western Reserve by the Connecticut Land
                Company.
                It was named after General Moses Cleaveland, an investor in the company who led the survey of its land
                within
                the Western Reserve. The town was located along the eastern bank of the Cuyahoga River. Because of a
                spelling
                error on the original map, the community has always been spelled Cleveland instead of Cleaveland. The
                first survey
                of Cleveland was completed in 1796, and it included 220 lots. The company originally charged fifty
                dollars for
                lots in the settlement and found that few people were willing to pay that much to live there. As late
                as 1800,
                a company representative reported that only three men lived in Cleveland. Ten years later, there were
                only fifty-seven
                residents. Despite its small population, Cleveland became the Cuyahoga County seat in 1807.
