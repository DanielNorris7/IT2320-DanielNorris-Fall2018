                The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio,
                recognizes and archives
                the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable
                figures who have had some
                major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was
                established on April 20, 1983,
                by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of
                Fame's permanent home.
