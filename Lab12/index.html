            <div>
                A guy named Moses Cleaveland, a surveyor from Connecticut, ventured west along Lake Erie many years ago
                and
                eventually landed in a forested area with the Cuyahoga River on one side and Lake Erie on another.
                He thought, “Yes, this would make a great place for a city!” And so, in 1796, Cleveland was officially
                born.
                (The “a” disappeared later.)

            <div>
                Cleveland is a major city in Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie. Landmarks dating to its days as a
                turn-of-the-20th-century
                manufacturing center include the Steamship William G. Mather,
                now part of the Great Lakes Science Center. It's also known for the stately Cleveland Museum of Art,
                the Cleveland
                Orchestra, and the I.M. Pei–designed Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum.
