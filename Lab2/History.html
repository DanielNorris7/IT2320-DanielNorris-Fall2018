        <h1>The History Of Cleveland</h1>
        <p>Cleveland was the first settlement founded in the Connecticut Western Reserve by the Connecticut Land Company.
            It was named after General Moses Cleaveland, an investor in the company who led the survey of its land within
            the Western Reserve. The town was located along the eastern bank of the Cuyahoga River. Because of a spelling
            error on the original map, the community has always been spelled Cleveland instead of Cleaveland. The first survey
            of Cleveland was completed in 1796, and it included 220 lots. The company originally charged fifty dollars for
            lots in the settlement and found that few people were willing to pay that much to live there. As late as 1800,
            a company representative reported that only three men lived in Cleveland. Ten years later, there were only fifty-seven
            residents. Despite its small population, Cleveland became the Cuyahoga County seat in 1807.
