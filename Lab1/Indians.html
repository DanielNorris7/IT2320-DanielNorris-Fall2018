            <p>The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. 
                The Indians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League 
                (AL) Central division. Since 1994, they have played at Progressive Field. The team's spring 
                training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona.[1] Since their establishment 
                as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series championships: in 1920 
                and 1948, along with nine Central Division titles and six American League pennants. 
                The Indians' current World Series championship drought is the longest active drought.
